# pyphon
Python sound change applier. Project is currently in prototype phase. For a functioning sound change applier, see Mark Rosenfelder's [sca2](https://www.zompist.com/sca2.html).

Currently I am working on creating a standardised phonetic handling library for Python over at *phond*, and creating the specification for *SCML* which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/fsbayer/pyphon/wiki/SCML-(Sound-Change-Markup-Language)).
